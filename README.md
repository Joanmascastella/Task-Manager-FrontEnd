**Project Description:**

My intention for this project was to create a task manager that allows a user to:
- Create tasks
- Organize them in lists
- Keep track of how much time they have worked on those tasks.

Additionally, I've implemented functionality for both admins and users to view basic analytics, including:
- The number of tasks created
- Completion rates of those tasks.
